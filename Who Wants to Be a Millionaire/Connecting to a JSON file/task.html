<p></p><h5 id="theory">Theory</h5><p><code class="java">Fetch</code> is the method for sending a network request to the server, so you can both get and send data.</p><p>The <code class="java">fetch(URL, options)</code> function takes two parameters:</p><ul><li><p>the URL to make the request to;</p></li><li><p><code class="java">options</code> (optional) is a configuration object where you can configure the <code class="java">request</code> method, request body, headers, and so on.</p></li></ul><p>The result of the <code class="java">fetch()</code> call will be a promise, which contains a special response object. This object has two important fields:</p><ul><li><p><code class="java">ok</code> accepts the true or false status and reports the success of the request;</p></li><li><p>the <code class="java">json</code> method; once is called, it returns the result of the request in the form of JSON.</p></li></ul><p>But when accessing a local file via <code class="java">fetch</code>, there may be a problem with the Same Origin Policy, which prohibits making requests to resources located in another domain.</p><p>In most browsers, such requests to local files are not allowed by default, which may cause a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error. To work around this problem, you can use a local server, such as an <code class="java">http-server</code>, which will allow you to run files on the local host and bypass the CORS policy.</p><p>to install:<br/><code class="java">npm install -g http-server</code><br/>starting from the directory where the HTML file is located:<br/><code class="java">http-server --cors</code><br/>url becomes as follows:<br/><code class="java">const URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/question.json';</code></p><p></p><div class="alert alert-primary"><p>Make sure you're running the local server while running the checks for the project. You should run the local server in the directory where the HTML file is located and it's important that you use the above URL.</p></div><p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Welcome to the first stage! In this stage, you need to get the file's contents by reference.</p><p>Notice the JSON file in the project folder. You will use the JSON file named <code class="java">question.json</code>.</p><p>This stage is simple, but very important since the file contains questions and various answers, among which one is correct. All the content will be used for our game to display information on the screen.</p><p>Questions and answers will be displayed on the page, but don't worry, it's only in this stage, to check out if the JSON file is connected. Then you should clear the page.</p><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>As a result of the stage, you should have the <code class="java">game()</code> function that accepts a URL with a JSON file. At the output on the page in the block with <code class="java">id=container</code>, there should be an array with questions, answers, and the correct answer.</p><h5 id="example">Example</h5><p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" height="319" src="https://ucarecdn.com/67e65cbb-bc95-463d-9bb5-aebfc9779f0e/-/preview/" width="1341"/></p>
